# Arcade-Shooting-Game
**Carnival Arcade Shooting Gallery Game Project**

Welcome to the "Carnival Arcade Shooting Gallery" game project! In this project, we'll be creating a classic arcade-style shooting gallery game using Python and the PyGame framework. The game will involve shooting at procedurally generated enemies, progressing through levels, implementing pause functionality, adding a main menu, and handling game over conditions.

**Setting up PyGame and Drawing Static Images**

Begin by installing the PyGame library using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame
```


Remember to include appropriate sounds, visual effects, and graphical elements to enhance the gaming experience.

This project will take you through the process of setting up the game, creating enemies, implementing shooting mechanics, handling levels, adding pause functionality, creating a main menu, and managing game over conditions. Get ready to have fun while building and playing your very own arcade-style game!
